The server takes the composition resource, locates all the referenced resources and other additional resources as configured or requested and either returns a full document bundle, or returns an error. Note that since this is a search operation, the document bundle is  wrapped inside the search bundle.  If some of the resources are located on other servers, it is at the discretion of the  server whether to retrieve them or return an error. If the correct version of the document  that would be generated already exists, then the server can return the existing one.","idempotent":false,"code":"document","comment":"Note: this operation definition does not resolve the question how document signatures are created.
