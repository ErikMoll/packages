Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium and duty of care. A policy holder is an individual or an organization enters into a contract with an underwriter which stipulates that, in exchange for payment of a sum of money (a premium), one or more covered parties (insureds) is guaranteed compensation for losses resulting from certain perils under specified conditions.  The underwriter analyzes the risk of loss, makes a decision as to whether the risk is insurable, and prices the premium accordingly.  A policy provides benefits that indemnify or cover the cost of a loss incurred by a covered party, and may include coverage for services required to remediate a loss.  An insurance policy contains pertinent facts about the policy holder, the insurance coverage, the covered parties, and the insurer.  A policy may include exemptions and provisions specifying the extent to which the indemnification clause cannot be enforced for intentional tortious conduct of a covered party, e.g., whether the covered parties are jointly or severably insured.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        \n                           Discussion: In contrast to programs, an insurance policy has one or more policy holders, who own the policy.  The policy holder may be the covered party, a relative of the covered party, a partnership, or a corporation, e.g., an employer.  A subscriber of a self-insured health insurance policy is a policy holder.  A subscriber of an employer sponsored health insurance policy is holds a certificate of coverage, but is not a policy holder; the policy holder is the employer.

A health insurance policy is a written contract for insurance between the insurance company and the policyholder, and contains pertinent facts about the policy owner (the policy holder), the health insurance coverage, the insured subscribers and dependents, and the insurer.  Health insurance is typically administered in accordance with a plan, which specifies (1) the type of health services and health conditions that will be covered under what circumstances (e.g., exclusion of a pre-existing condition, service must be deemed medically necessary; service must not be experimental; service must provided in accordance with a protocol; drug must be on a formulary; service must be prior authorized; or be a referral from a primary care provider); (2) the type and affiliation of providers (e.g., only allopathic physicians, only in network, only providers employed by an HMO); (3) financial participations required of covered parties (e.g., co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, out-of-pocket); and (4) the manner in which services will be paid (e.g., under indemnity or fee-for-service health plans, the covered party typically pays out-of-pocket and then file a claim for reimbursement, while health plans that have contractual relationships with providers, i.e., network providers, typically do not allow the providers to bill the covered party for the cost of the service until after filing a claim with the payer and receiving reimbursement).\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>      DENTAL\n                  <a name=\"DENTAL\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>dental care policy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A health insurance policy that that covers benefits for dental services.\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>      DISEASE\n                  <a name=\"DISEASE\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>disease specific policy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A health insurance policy that covers benefits for healthcare services provided for named conditions under the policy, e.g., cancer, diabetes, or HIV-AIDS.\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>      DRUGPOL\n                  <a name=\"DRUGPOL\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>drug policy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A health insurance policy that covers benefits for prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals, and supplies.\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>      \n                  <a href=\"#EHCPOL\">EHCPOL</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>      HIP\n                  <a name=\"HIP\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>health insurance plan policy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A health insurance policy that covers healthcare benefits by protecting covered parties from medical expenses arising from health conditions, sickness, or accidental injury as well as preventive care.

Providers are typically reimbursed for covered services by a capitated amount on a per member per month basis that may reflect difference in the health status and level of services anticipated to be needed by the member.\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>        POS\n                  <a name=\"POS\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>point of service policy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A policy for a health plan that has features of both an HMO and a FFS plan.  Like an HMO, a POS plan encourages the use its HMO network to maintain discounted fees with participating providers, but recognizes that sometimes covered parties want to choose their own provider.  The POS plan allows a covered party to use providers who are not part of the HMO network (non-participating providers).  However, there is a greater cost associated with choosing these non-network providers. A covered party will usually pay deductibles and coinsurances that are substantially higher than the payments when he or she uses a plan provider. Use of non-participating providers often requires the covered party to pay the provider directly and then to file a claim for reimbursement, like in an FFS plan.\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>        HMO\n                  <a name=\"HMO\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>health maintenance organization policy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A policy for a health plan that provides coverage for health care only through contracted or employed physicians and hospitals located in particular geographic or service areas.

Life insurance indemnifies the beneficiary for the loss of the insurable interest that a beneficiary has in the life of a covered party.  For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person.

Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years).\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>      ANNU\n                  <a name=\"ANNU\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>annuity policy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A policy that, after an initial premium or premiums, pays out a sum at pre-determined intervals.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        For example, a policy holder may pay $10,000, and in return receive $150 each month until he dies; or $1,000 for each of 14 years or death benefits if he dies before the full term of the annuity has elapsed.\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>      TLIFE\n                  <a name=\"TLIFE\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>term life insurance policy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        \n                           Definition: Life insurance under which the benefit is payable only if the insured dies during a specified period.

A government agency may be charged with implementing the program in accordance to the regulation.  Risk of loss under a program in most cases would not meet what an underwriter would consider an insurable risk, i.e., the risk is not random in nature, not financially measurable, and likely requires subsidization with government funds.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        \n                           Discussion: Programs do not have policy holders or subscribers.  Program eligibles are enrolled based on health status, statutory eligibility, financial status, or age.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description:  Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles.  A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy).   These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine.  A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy.  When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information.  This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        \n                           Usage Note: Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements.  For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain.   'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly.  Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply.  Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly.  The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>      \n                  <span style=\"color: grey\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>(_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy)</i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>Abstract</i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a name=\"_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        Types of sensitivity policies that apply to Acts.

Constraints: The kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding systems.  The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc. Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure. Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code \"potassium\" together with and Act.classCode for \"laboratory observation\" to somehow mean \"potassium laboratory observation\" and then use the same Act.code for \"potassium\" together with Act.classCode for \"medication\" to mean \"substitution of potassium\".

Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium and duty of care. A policy holder is an individual or an organization enters into a contract with an underwriter which stipulates that, in exchange for payment of a sum of money (a premium), one or more covered parties (insureds) is guaranteed compensation for losses resulting from certain perils under specified conditions.  The underwriter analyzes the risk of loss, makes a decision as to whether the risk is insurable, and prices the premium accordingly.  A policy provides benefits that indemnify or cover the cost of a loss incurred by a covered party, and may include coverage for services required to remediate a loss.  An insurance policy contains pertinent facts about the policy holder, the insurance coverage, the covered parties, and the insurer.  A policy may include exemptions and provisions specifying the extent to which the indemnification clause cannot be enforced for intentional tortious conduct of a covered party, e.g., whether the covered parties are jointly or severably insured.                                                      Discussion: In contrast to programs, an insurance policy has one or more policy holders, who own the policy.  The policy holder may be the covered party, a relative of the covered party, a partnership, or a corporation, e.g., an employer.

Discussion: Reinsurance is a means by which an insurance company can protect itself against the risk of losses with other insurance companies. Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.                          For example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description:  Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles.  A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy).   These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine.  A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy.  When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information.  This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.                                                      Usage Note: Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements.  For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain.   'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly.  Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply.  Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly.  The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.","property":[{"code":"abstract","valueBoolean":true}],"concept":[{"code":"_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy","display":"ActInformationSensitivityPolicy","definition":"Types of sensitivity policies that apply to Acts.
