	  for this example, we use a real URI, since this example does have a canonical address
		at which it's posted. Alternatively, We could have used an OID, or a UUID.
 
    Mote that this isn't the identifier for the LOINC codes themeselves - they belong to LOINC, and 
		it has it's own identifier. This is the identifier for this set of codes, and that doesn't 
		change the codes.
       --><url value="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-extensional"/><!--      an imaginary identifier. This is a non FHIR identifier - might be used in a 
	  v2 context (though you always need to translate namespaces for v2)      --><identifier><system value="http://acme.com/identifiers/valuesets"/><value value="loinc-cholesterol-int"/></identifier><!--      for version, we are going to simply use the day of publication. This is also 
    arbitrary - whatever is here is what people use to refer to the version. 
    Could also be a UUID too      --><version value="20150622"/><!--      set of loinc codes for cholesterol for LONC 2.36      --><name value="LOINC Codes for Cholesterol in Serum/Plasma"/><status value="draft"/><experimental value="true"/><publisher value="HL7 International"/><contact><name value="FHIR project team"/><telecom><system value="other"/><value value="http://hl7.org/fhir"/></telecom></contact><date value="2015-06-22"/><!--      
	  if we didn't specify the version of LOINC on the include, then
	  we could specify it implicitly by specifying the locked date for the value set
		
		So we show this example here, but it's not actually necessary since we also 
    have LOINC version. Note: if you do what this example does, and specify both,
		you better get it right, and specify the current version of LOINC at the time

				  In this value set, we provide our own displays. 
					
					You have to be very careful doing this; it's all too 
					easy to specify a different or lesser meaning, and then
					people use codes wrongly ()with obvious consequences for clinical safety)
				
				  You're allowed to do this in a value set for 2 reasons:
					  - people do it anyway
						- it does make sense to remove common text that's fixed in the context
						
			    In this case, that's what we're doing here - removing
					'serum/plasma' from the names, since that's specified in the
					value set name      --><display value="Cholesterol [Moles/Volume]"/></concept><concept><code value="2093-3"/><display value="Cholesterol [Mass/Volume]"/></concept><concept><code value="35200-5"/><display value="Cholesterol [Mass Or Moles/Volume]"/></concept><!--      this is a different kind of code; whether it should be 
			  in a value set like this is a matter of clinical judgement.
				it's here in this example value set to raise the question
				for implementers      --><concept><code value="9342-7"/><display value="Cholesterol [Percentile]"/></concept></include></compose></ValueSet>
