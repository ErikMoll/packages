	  for this example, we use a real URI, since this example does have a canonical address
		at which it's posted. Alternatively, We could have used an OID, or a UUID      --><url value="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-inline"/><!--      an imaginary identifier. This is a non FHIR identifier - might be used in a 
	  v2 context (though you always need to translate namespaces for v2)      --><identifier><system value="http://acme.com/identifiers/valuesets"/><value value="loinc-cholesterol-inl"/></identifier><!--      for version, we are going to simply use the day of publication. This is also 
    arbitrary - whatever is here is what people use to refer to the version. 
    Could also be a UUID too      --><version value="20150622"/><!--      set of loinc codes for cholesterol for LONC 2.36      --><name value="ACME Codes for Cholesterol in Serum/Plasma"/><status value="draft"/><experimental value="true"/><publisher value="HL7 International"/><contact><name value="FHIR project team"/><telecom><system value="other"/><value value="http://hl7.org/fhir"/></telecom></contact><date value="2015-06-22"/><description value="This is an example value set that includes all the ACME codes for serum/plasma cholesterol from v2.36."/><!--      
		This value set publishes the underlying definition of the ACME code system
		We don't keep track of authorship etc. here - we assume that ACME has a
		system for that. We're just representing the public face of the code 
		system for external users
	     --><codeSystem><!--     
			note that since we give a literal URL here, there's an expectation 
			that accessing that URL will give some form of representation of 
			the full code system, or a pointer about how to get more infomration. 
	
			This is not an absolute requirement, but it may be enforced by some 
			servers - for instance, the HL7 valueset registry will.      --><system value="http://acme.com/config/fhir/codesystems/cholesterol"/><!--      version is not mandatory, but is highly recommended. Note that 
			you should change the identify of the code system if existing codes 
			are redefined      --><version value="4.2.3"/><!--      it's often unstated - are codes case sensitive or not. And 
       it can be the cause of operational or clinical safety problems. 
       So FHIR requires that it always be specified.      --><caseSensitive value="true"/><!--      
			ACME's defined definitions. Note that these are not 
			*good* definitions - but they are very commonly the kind 
			of definitions that are encountered in production
