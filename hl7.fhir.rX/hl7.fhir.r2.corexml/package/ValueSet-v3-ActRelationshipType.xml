Examples                                                                                     The first Act may be a ControlAct manipulating the subject Act                                                                                         The first act is a region of interest (ROI) that defines a region within the subject Act.                                                                                        The first act is a reporting or notification Act, that echos the subject Act for a specific new purpose.                                                                               Constraints                          An Act may have multiple subject acts.                          Rationale                          The ActRelationshipType &quot;has subject&quot; is similar to the ParticipationType &quot;subject&quot;, Acts that primarily operate on physical subjects use the Participation, those Acts that primarily operate on other Acts (other information) use the ActRelationship."/><concept><code value="QUALF"/><abstract value="false"/><display value="has qualifier"/><definition value="The target observation qualifies (refines) the semantics of the source observation.

FormalConstraint: Source Act must be an Observation or specialization there-of. Source Act must not have the value attribute specified                                                      UsageNote: This relationship allows the result of an observation to be fully expressed as RIM acts as opposed to being embedded in the value attribute.  For example, sending a Document act as the result of an imaging observation, sending a list of Procedures and/or other acts as the result of a medical history observation.                          The valueNegationInd attribute on the source Act has the same semantics of &quot;negated finding&quot; when it applies to the target of a VALUE ActRelationship as it does to the value attribute.  On the other hand, if the ActRelationship.negationInd is true for a VALUE ActRelationship, that means the specified observation does not have the indicated value but does not imply a negated finding.  Because the semantics are extremely close, it is recommended that Observation.valueNegationInd be used, not ActRelationship.negationInd.
