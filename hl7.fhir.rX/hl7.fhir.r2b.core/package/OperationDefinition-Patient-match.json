Healthcare applications and middleware use the MPI to match patients between the databases, and as new patient details are encountered. MPIs are highly specialized applications, often tailored extensively to the institution\u0027s particular mix of patients. MPIs can also be run on a regional and national basis.  To ask an MPI to match a patient, clients use the \"mpi\" query, which takes either a candidate patient resource, or a set of normal search parameters defined for patient. The data provided is interpreted as an MPI input and  passed to an MPI algorithm of some kind that uses them to determine the most appropriate matches in the patient set.   Note that different MPI matching algorithms have different required inputs. The generic $match operation does not specify any particular algorithm, nor a minimum set of information that must be provided when asking for an MPI match operation to be performed, but may implementations will have a set of minimum information, which may be declared in their definition of the $match operation","idempotent":false,"code":"match","comment":"The response from an \"mpi\" query is a bundle containing patient records, ordered from most likely to least likely. If there are no patient matches, the MPI SHALL return an empty search set with no error, but may include an operation outcome with further advice regarding patient selection. All patient records SHALL have a search score from 0 to 1, where 1 is the most certain match, along with an extension \"[match-grade](extension-match-grade.html)\" that indicates the MPI\u0027s position on the match quality.","system":false,"type":["Patient"],"instance":false,"parameter":[{"name":"patient","use":"in","min":0,"max":"1","documentation":"Use this to provide an entire set of patient details for the MPI to match against (e.g. POST a patient record to Patient/$match).
