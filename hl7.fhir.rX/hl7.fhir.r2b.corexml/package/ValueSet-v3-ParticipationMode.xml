Examples: Physically present, over the telephone, written communication.  Rationale: Particularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.  Open Issue: There needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic communication that are in other hierarchies."/><immutable value="false"/><extensible value="false"/><compose><include><system value="http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode"/></include></compose></ValueSet>
