For example, if the start and end of an ST elevation episode is visible in an EKG, this relation would indicate the ROI bounds the  &quot;ST elevation&quot; observation -- the ROI defines the true beginning and ending of the episode.  Conversely, if a ROI simply contains ST elevation, but it does not define the bounds (start and end) of the episode, the more general &quot;has support&quot; relation is used.  Likewise, if a ROI on an image defines the true bounds of a &quot;1st degree burn&quot;, the relation &quot;has bounded support&quot; is used; but if the ROI only points to the approximate area of the burn, the general &quot;has support&quot; relation is used.\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>  SUBJ\n                  <a name=\"SUBJ\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>has subject</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        Relates an Act to its subject Act that the first Act is primarily concerned with.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        Examples\n                  <br/>\n\n                        \n                           \n                              The first Act may be a ControlAct manipulating the subject Act \n                  <br/>\n\n                           \n                           \n                              The first act is a region of interest (ROI) that defines a region within the subject Act.\n                  <br/>\n\n                           \n                           \n                              The first act is a reporting or notification Act, that echos the subject Act for a specific new purpose.\n                  <br/>\n\n                           \n                        \n                        Constraints\n                  <br/>\n\n                        An Act may have multiple subject acts.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        Rationale\n                  <br/>\n\n                        The ActRelationshipType &quot;has subject&quot; is similar to the ParticipationType &quot;subject&quot;, Acts that primarily operate on physical subjects use the Participation, those Acts that primarily operate on other Acts (other information) use the ActRelationship.\n                  <br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>    QUALF\n                  <a name=\"QUALF\"> </a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>has qualifier</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>\n                        The target observation qualifies (refines) the semantics of the source observation.\n                  <br/>\n\n                        \n                           UsageNote: This is not intended to replace concept refinement and qualification via vocabulary.

The valueNegationInd attribute on the source Act has the same semantics of \"negated finding\" when it applies to the target of a VALUE ActRelationship as it does to the value attribute.  On the other hand, if the ActRelationship.negationInd is true for a VALUE ActRelationship, that means the specified observation does not have the indicated value but does not imply a negated finding.  Because the semantics are extremely close, it is recommended that Observation.valueNegationInd be used, not ActRelationship.negationInd.
