This operation is focused on [Observation](observation.html) resources with valueQuantity elements that have UCUM unit codes.&#xA;&#xA;The set of Observations is defined by 4 parameters:&#xA;&#xA;*  the subject of the observations for which the statistics are being generated (`subject`)&#xA;* which observations to generate statistics for (`code` and `system`, or `coding`)&#xA;* the time period over which to generate statistics `&#39;duration` or `period`)&#xA;* the set of statistical analyses to return (`statistic`)&#xA;&#xA;Possible statistical analyses (see [StatisticsCode](valueset-observation-statistics.html)):&#xA;&#xA; - **average** (&quot;Average&quot;): The [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **maximum** (&quot;Maximum&quot;): The [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_element) value of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **minimum** (&quot;Minimum&quot;): The [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element) value of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **count** (&quot;Count&quot;): The [number] of valid measurements over the stated period that contributed to the other statistical outputs&#xD;&#xA; - **totalcount** (&quot;Total Count&quot;): The total [number] of valid measurements over the stated period, including observations that were ignored because they did not contain valid result values&#xD;&#xA; - **median** (&quot;Median&quot;): The [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **std-dev** (&quot;Standard Deviation&quot;): The [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **sum** (&quot;Sum&quot;): The [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **variance** (&quot;Variance&quot;): The [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **20-percent** (&quot;20th Percentile&quot;): The 20th [Percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **80-percent** (&quot;80th Percentile&quot;): The 80th [Percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **4-lower** (&quot;Lower Quartile&quot;): The lower [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) Boundary of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **4-upper** (&quot;Upper Quartile&quot;): The upper [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) Boundary of N measurements over the stated period&#xD;&#xA; - **4-dev** (&quot;Quartile Deviation&quot;): The difference between the upper and lower [Quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) is called the Interquartile range. (IQR = Q3-Q1) Quartile deviation or Semi-interquartile range is one-half the difference between the first and the third quartiles.&#xD;&#xA; - **5-1** (&quot;1st Quintile&quot;): The lowest of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population&#xD;&#xA; - **5-2** (&quot;2nd Quintile&quot;): The second of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population&#xD;&#xA; - **5-3** (&quot;3rd Quintile&quot;): The third of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population&#xD;&#xA; - **5-4** (&quot;4th Quintile&quot;): The fourth of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population&#xD;&#xA; - **skew** (&quot;Skew&quot;): Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or even undefined.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness)&#xD;&#xA; - **kurtosis** (&quot;Kurtosis&quot;): Kurtosis  is a measure of the &quot;tailedness&quot; of the&#xA0;probability distribution&#xA0;of a&#xA0;real-valued&#xA0;random variable.   Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis)&#xD;&#xA; - **regression** (&quot;Regression&quot;): Linear regression is an approach for modeling two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables.

The Observation also contains the input parameters `patient`,`code` and `duration` parameters. If unsuccessful, an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) with an error message will be returned.&#xA;&#xA;The client can request that all the observations on which the statistics are based be returned as well, using the include parameter. If an include parameter is specified, a limit may also be specified; the sources observations are subsetted at the server&#39;s discretion if count &gt; limit.
