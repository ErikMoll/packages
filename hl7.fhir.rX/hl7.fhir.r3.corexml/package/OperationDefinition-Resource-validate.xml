The action the server takes depends on the mode parameter:  &#xA;&#xA;* [mode not provided]: The server checks the content of the resource against any schema, constraint rules, and other general terminology rules &#xA;* create: The server checks the content, and then checks that the content would be acceptable as a create (e.g. that the content would not violate any uniqueness constraints) &#xA;* update: The server checks the content, and then checks that it would accept it as an update against the nominated specific resource (e.g. that there are no changes to immutable fields the server does not allow to change, and checking version integrity if appropriate) &#xA;* delete: The server ignores the content, and checks that the nominated resource is allowed to be deleted (e.g. checking referential integrity rules)  &#xA;&#xA;Modes update and delete can only be used when the operation is invoked at the resource instance level.   The return from this operation is an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html)"/><code value="validate"/><comment value="This operation may be used during design and development to validate application design. It can also be used at run-time. One possible use might be that a client asks the server whether a proposed update is valid as the user is editing a dialog and displays an updated error to the user. The operation can be used as part of a light-weight two phase commit protocol but there is no expectation that the server will hold the content of the resource after this operation is used, or that the server guarantees to successfully perform an actual create, update or delete after the validation operation completes.&#xA;&#xA;This operation returns a 200 OK whether or not the resource is valid. A 4xx or 5xx error means that the validation itself could not be performed, and it is unknown whether the resource is valid or not."/><resource value="Resource"/><system value="false"/><type value="true"/><instance value="true"/><parameter><name value="resource"/><use value="in"/><min value="0"/><max value="1"/><documentation value="Must be present unless the mode is &quot;delete&quot;"/><type value="Resource"/></parameter><parameter><name value="mode"/><use value="in"/><min value="0"/><max value="1"/><documentation value="Default is &#39;no action&#39;; (e.g. general validation)"/><type value="code"/><binding><strength value="required"/><valueSetReference><reference value="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/resource-validation-mode"/></valueSetReference></binding></parameter><parameter><name value="profile"/><use value="in"/><min value="0"/><max value="1"/><documentation value="If this is nominated, then the resource is validated against this specific profile.
