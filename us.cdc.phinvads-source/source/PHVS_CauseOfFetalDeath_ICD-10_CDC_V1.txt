Cause of Fetal Death ICD-10	PHVS_CauseOfFetalDeath_ICD-10_CDC	2.16.840.1.114222.4.11.7933	1	This value set contains the ICD10 codes for causes 
of fetal death as defined by the ICD-10-Mortality 
Fetal Manual (2016).  Defined as the following, 
a cause of fetal death is the morbid condition 
or disease process, abnormality, injury, or poisoning 
leading directly to fetal death. The initiating 
cause of fetal death is the disease or injury, 
which initiated the chain of morbid events 
leading directly to death or the circumstances 
of the accident or violence, which produced fatal 
injury. A fetal death often results from the 
combined effect of two or more conditions. These 
conditions may be completely unrelated, arising 
independently of each other or they may be causally 
related to each other; that is, one cause may 
lead to another which in turn, leads to a third 
cause, etc.	Published	02/28/2020	v1
