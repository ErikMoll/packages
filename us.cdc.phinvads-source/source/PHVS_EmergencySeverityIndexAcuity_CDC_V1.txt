Emergency Severity Index - Acuity	PHVS_EmergencySeverityIndexAcuity_CDC	2.16.840.1.114222.4.11.7776	1	The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a tool for use in emergency department (ED) triage. The ESI triage algorithm yields rapid, reproducible, and clinically relevant stratification of patients into five groups, from level 1 (most urgent) to level 5 (least urgent). The ESI provides a method for categorizing ED patients by both acuity and resource needs.
